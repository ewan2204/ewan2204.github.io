Trying is something that is important for all people to do.

Dislike that the date is written backwards it's annoying.

I dislike the fact within markdown you need to either double slash iirc or double enter to actually get a newline

Sometimes I just want a new line instead, there is probably a setting which allows this to be the case but right now there are more important things to consider.

Should I go and port over my old website's content thinking_emoji :?

Why am I doing this?
