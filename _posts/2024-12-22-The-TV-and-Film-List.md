## What is "The List"

Over the past few years we've effectively watched very little television and film products, especially those suggested by others sadly. However, this does not reflect the truth because there are a lot of teleiviosn and films that we do actually want to watch. Every time someone suggests some media franchise, and if it's good, it's mentally added to the list.

This is vaguely that list.

## TV

<details>
<summary>Arcane</summary>
<br>
League of legends might be mid, but the music that comes from this and Valorant... shorts??? is very good.
Interested to watch.
</details>

<details>
<summary>House of the Dragon</summary>
<br>
Game of Thrones ended on a low note, but this series promises potentially more of the good parts from GOT. ++ the friends go wild over this one.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Chernobyl</summary>
<br>
Watched part of this in a physics class, unsure why we did this but. Seems interesting short Mini Series but still up there to watch.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Attack on Titan</summary>
<br>
People love their anime, this in particular is a large one. The problem in our eyes though is 98 episodes, although if it's good I suppose there can never be too much.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Death Note</summary>
<br>
This is an iconic one, we want to know why light yagimi hates dark yagami so much and why is L scared of M? Is it because she's played by Judi Dench?
</details>



<details>
<summary>Peaky Blinders</summary>
<br>

Love this gif. Like what is he doing in the misty terrain? Why is he so angry. What's up with him?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ozark</summary>
<br>
Jason Bateman was good in arrested development, Game night and maybe just maybe Ozark??
</details>

<details>
<summary>The Boys</summary>
<br>
We love an anti-hero superhero TV show. 
</details>


<details>
<summary>Stranger Things</summary>
<br>
An oh so suggested one, maybe we should get a haircut to look like character with mullet ice cream outfit man.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Neon Genesis Evangelion</summary>
<br>
Giant Robot.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ted Lasso</summary>
<br>
Football idk not a big football guy but.
</details>



<details>
<summary>Wednesday</summary>
<br>
At this point feels like any TV show from the past 5 years is being included.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Barry</summary>
<br>
Bill Hader is a person. Sadly you can't play TV shows in CineNerdle2.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Black Mirror</summary>
<br>
To some extent this watching would be miserable. We get sad easily and techno future sad would be even sadder.
</details>

<details>
<summary>The Witcher</summary>
<br>
The one song is actually pretty good. Also, would be hoping gets us back into playing the Witcher 3 so we can cross that off the games we need to play.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Lucifer</summary>
<br>
Watched majority of the seasons just have the last half of the final season to watch. It's okkkk.
