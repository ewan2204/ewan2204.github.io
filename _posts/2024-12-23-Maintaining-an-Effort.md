## Effort over time

It's easy enough to make an effort, the problem is when you need to do that over and over again.

If you do something enough to become a routine, that's when it becomes easier to maintain.

Right now we're trying to install Ruby and Bundler and Jekyll to locally test the website because at this moment the blog main page has an issue. Shocking isn't it!

Hopefully, once we can locally run this site it'll be easy enough to fix that because ideally we should remove all friction between effort and effect. We find that the easier one can see results the more motivated they are, this is a benefit of fast iterative design.

## Local GitHub-Pages 

We now have ruby, bundler and jekyll installed.

Took some more effort and figuring out you first have to, similarly to a git repo, initialise the gem file first before you can start adding to it. Once, we got through that hurdle it was not too bad so now we can easily modify how to date is handled. Everyone can celebrate.
