# Welcome?
Many question marks are used as I don't yet fully grasp how to set this up. Further, I mean the recommendation that I use GitHub's built in editor is funny. I remember a classic time during a group project when using "normal" non computer computer computers which didn't even have notepad++ installed let alone visual studio code or otherwise, that we had to use GitHub's editor. I do not recommend this it's an insane way to code.

To write a blog though, perhaps not??
